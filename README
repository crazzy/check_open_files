Simple Nagios/OP5 plugin which checks the amount of filehandles used vs the limits, both system-wide and per process.

For now only works on Linux, could be fixed but would require:
  * Checking uname() result for OS
  * Checking different sysctl's for different OS's and perhaps other places for OS's that doesn't use sysctl
  * Figuring out the alternative for Linux prlimit() for those OS's

No docs, read the code.
